Simulation of a digital transmission system use Matlab at a data rate of 8 Mb/s. 
Information resource of the system is a binary signal sequence equivalent randomization has size equal to 1000000. 
Use 2-DPSK modulation for digital transmission system. Using a baseband equivalent simulation model, the transmitted signal can be represented as follows:
s(t) = âˆ‘ dk * p(t-kTsym) * e^(j*theta0) 
in there
     dk are complex symbols determined from the input message sequence and modulation technique;
     Tsym is the period of the symbol;
     theta0 is the phase of the transmitted signal;
     p(t) defines the type of pulse to be transmitted, with:
     p(t) = sqrt(2*Es/Tsym) * (1-cos(2*pi*t/Tsym))
     where Es is the energy per symbol
